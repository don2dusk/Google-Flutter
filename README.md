# GoogleFlutter
A [Google](https://google.com) Clone Implemented with Flutter.

## What did I do?
Well, I made a Responsive Google Search Engine Clone using Flutter. This means that the layout changes based on the screen size, layout or platform (see screenshots below). I also implemented Google's Custom Search API to fetch search results from the internet and display them to the user in realtime. This was a simple project I really enjoyed making.
